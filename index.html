                        Firstly, i thought of doing something with a dnd("dungeons and dragons") dice and then add some symbols on its sides
                        that represented both sound and image/video, but after messing around with it, i came to the conclusion that maybe a
                        dice with 20 sides would be a bit too complex for an icon, so i gave up that idea.
                        
                        Second try i made a pair of headphones with a cd/dvd in between them, and then added a sort of soundwave to the disc to
                        make it look “cooler”. This was however failing to represent both image and the “gamefication” of the course.
                        
                        In the next tries i played around with poligonal shapes(since people normally associate them with videogames, as well as
                        it makes the icon look simpler) and symbols that could represent both image and sound. In my final try, i made a sort of
                        fusion between a speaker icon and an eye(a sideways eye), and that was the design i decided to go with, as it
                        represented both sound, image, and the angular sides made it look a bit “videogamey”.
                        
                        I then opened inkscape and made my first design. The first design looked nice, however i thought the part representing
                        the iris of the eye looked a bit too small when i zoomed out...
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/courseLogo/1.png" style="width: 500px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        so in the final design i decided to make it a bit bigger. As it was still a bit hard to tell if the icon was also a
                        speaker, i also added some sound waves coming out of it. After i was happy with the design, i then started playing with
                        color pallets until i found the one i liked the most.

                    <p>
                        Hello, here's my attempt at the movie poster skill!<br>
                        <b>About the Movie:</b><br>
                        Based on the coming-of-age novel written by American novelist Louisa May Alcott, Little Women chronicles the lives of
                        the March sisters—Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth-, who reside with their mother in post-Civil War America. The story tells of<br>
                        how they grow up, find love and find their place in the world.<br>
                        <b>Creation Process:</b><br>
                        I read this book several years ago and when the movie came out I wasn't very hopeful about it, since it is extremely<br>
                        difficult to do justice to a good book through a limited-time movie. However, it really surprised me: Greta Gerwig<br>
                        managed to create an independent and contemporary piece while staying faithful to its source material - and the presence<br>
                        of a fantastic cast certainly helped.<br>

                        For that reason, I thought this movie would be a good choice to make a poster of it.<br>

                        Since the movie is based on a 19th century book, I thought it would make perfect sense to use an illustration rather<br>
                        than a photo as the film's image. However, an illustration of any characters would have to portray real actors. I found<br>
                        this drawing on Google that met those requirements, depicting one of the most iconic images from the movie, so I decided<br>
                        to use it:<br>
                    </p>
                    <img class="post-content-img-sm" src="resources/MoviePoster/Francisca Paiva/little women.PNG" style="min-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        The picture's quality was not the best so I had to enhance it, and then I removed its background.
                        
                        I wanted to convey the idea that the movie tells the story of each of the sisters, together, but also individually, so I
                        thought a good way to do it would be to add a different colored stripe behind each of them. I then chose a palette that
                        I thought would suit the movie, edited the image on Photoshop according to it and added the title and the tagline to
                        match the colors of the stripes. I also added some shadows to these elements, in order to make them more prominent.
                        Since writing also plays a big role in the film, I thought it would be nice to replace the 'i' in the title with a
                        writing quill.
                        
                        Finally, I added the director's and main actor's names using the font 'Poppins' (the same as the tagline), and the
                        billing block. Since this element had little contrast with the sisters' skirts, I decided to add a frame all the way
                        around the poster.
                        
                        The entire creation process was done in Illustrator.
                        
                        <b>Final Result:</b>

                <div class="modal-body post-content">
                    <p><b>1. Finding Image</b>
                        I searched artstation.com with the keyword "interstellar". I was inspired by the beautiful artworks that represented
                        space as a lonely place. I decided to use an artistic image of a black hole, since *spoiler alert*, there is a black
                        hole in the movie that looks just the same, and would communicate clearly that the movie is about space.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img class="post-content-img-sm" src="resources/MoviePoster/Paulina/black_hole_small.jpg" style="min-width: 300px;"><br>
                    <p><b>Composing & Design  </b>                   </p>
                    <img class="post-content-img-sm" src="resources/MoviePoster/Paulina/making_of_movie_poster (1).gif" style="min-width: 300px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        The chosen image has a single strong focal point - the black hole itself - which makes it easy to compose around it. I flipped the image vertically so that the brighter part of the background would be on the top. I envisioned it as light guiding the eye from top to bottom of the poster. The black background would also serve perfectly for placing a lot of text (title, billing block and extras).

                        I positioned the picture to my linking on the canvas with the poster aspect ratio and used Content Aware Fill in Adobe Photoshop to fill in the white areas.
                        
                        Next think I wrote "Interstellar" with the Copperplate Gothic Bold font and positioned it.
                        
                        In order to integrate the title into the poster, I had the idea to make the letter T into a spaceship, with smoke coming from the back of it. I also wanted to integrate the billing block in a suitable way, and thought of the billing block "opening" from the middle, creating a path for the spaceship. I drew a placeholder shape of the billing block, then filled it with placeholder text and font.
                        
                        For extra information, I added the names of the most recognizable actors on the top of the poster, using the Cocogoose UltraLight font.
                        
                        After having the composition in place, the rest was polishing and aligning of the elements, filling the billing block with correct information (where I used the Ignotum font).
                        
                        The subtitle has a dim glow effect and a perspective distortion to it, written in Century Gothic.
                        
                        For the "special effects" of the spaceship I used two simple photoshop brushes and a distortion effect for the engine smoke.<br>
                        <b>Result:</b>

                    <p>
                        Hello! Here is my submission for this skill:<br>

                        <br>I knew I wanted to make a poster for a drama movie since that is my favorite movie genre.<br>

                        <br>I ended up deciding I wanted to make a poster for a movie about a girl that moves to a big city (something she is not familiar with) and about her adaptation to that new reality and how, with some difficulties, she is eventually able to fit in.<br>

                        <br>For the poster I chose a picture of a woman and another one of a city and tried do combine both with a fade, to express how she is able to slowly integrate. I really like the poster of Marriage Story and wanted to do something relatively similar. I searched for some double exposure tutorials and palyed a little bit with masks on photoshop.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img class="post-content-img-sm" src="resources/moviePoster/Beatriz_Feliciano/postwoman.jpg" style="min-width: 300px;">
                    <img class="post-content-img-sm" src="resources/moviePoster/Beatriz_Feliciano/postcity.jpg" style="min-width: 295px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Finally it was time to choose the font I wanted for the title of my movie. I knew I wanted a sans serif font since it has a progressive feel which fits perfectly the idea of adaptation present in the movie. After some time searching, I ended up choosing the Vancouver font.<br>

                        <br>For the names of the actors I searched some commonly used fonts for that purpose and ended up choosing the SF Movie Poster font. For the billing block I only used a png with information from another movie and added a slight gradient to improve its legibility.<br>

                        <br>Here is the final result, I hope you like it :)

                    <p>
                        I've always loved movie posters done in a more <b>illustration-based, sort of minimalistic way,</b> and they've certainly always caught my eye when trying to pick a movie at the cinema because their style stands out from the others. So I decided to give it a try!<br>

                        <br>First, I had to pick a movie. I wanted to pick something that was less "commercial" (since it would go perfectly with this style), while still being a well-known movie that people would recognize. I ended up choosing a French-German romantic comedy from 2001 called "Amélie".<br>

                        <br>The main character, Amélie, is a young woman that has a pretty vivid imagination and a mischievous personality, who discretely orchestrates the lives of the people around her, creating a world exclusively of her own making. She eventually falls in love with this man and the film ends with both of them riding around in a scooter, as <b>"Amélie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself"</b>. I picked this particular scene as inspiration for the poster because it's such a blissful moment in the movie and I thought it really captured Amélie's happiness.<br>

                        <br>Then I started working on the poster, using Photoshop.<br>


                        <br><b>Here are some steps I took:</b></br>
                        - I found a couple riding a scooter that looked a lot like Amélie and Nino so I just cut them, changed the colour to white, and placed them centered;<br>
                        - I drew a curvy road with the pen-tool;<br>
                        - I decided to create this sort of frame around the poster so I could block colour (red/white) and balance it all out;<br>
                        - I added some texture to the key art, so it wouldn't be so perfect and crisp;<br>
                        - Then, it was just a matter of adding the title, director, main actors and the billing block.<br>

                        <br><b>Here's the final result:</b>
                    </p>

                        kill you. I started by writing the plot and describing what each panel would represent. Then I grabbed my sketchpad and
                        pecil and sketched the characters. I created two characters, a girl and her cat. Finally, I divided a sheet into four
                        panels and started drawing from the plot. I used no references and soon gave up on drawing hands properly. There were
                        some positioning issues along with major anatomy problems which I only fixed on the svg version. I scanned both drawing
                        with my mobile phone and then jumped to Inkscape. I had an issue with not knowing how to properly function with OBS so I
                        lost the process of drawing the girl in the first panel. I cried a bit and moved on. Most of the work was done by using
                        the freehand drawing tool and tweaking the nodes and curves. I tried to color it, but I didn't like the result, so I
                        just colored the eyes and some deatils here and there to create deapth. On the sketch I had a 2x2 layout, but then I
                        reorganized it to be a 4x1.
                        
                        Here's the character sheet:<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's the script:
                        Panel 1:
                        [Character frustrated, sitting at the desk with a drawing pad.]
                        "I have no ideas for the comic strip!"

                        Panel 2:
                        [Full body character gets up and picks her cat up]
                        "If only you could help me!"

                        Panel 3:
                        [Close up of the cat, big oblivious eyes]
                        (Voice off) "That's it! I'm going to make a comic about--"

                        Panel 4:
                        [Big hourglass with "deadlines" written on it falls on top of her, cat scared]

                        Here's the sketch of the comic strip:<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/ComicStrip/comic.jpg" style="min-width: 200px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I grabbed all the screen recordings and imported them to Shotcut in order to cut out the parts where it's just
                        my desktop with the OBS window. I had to speed up the video twice because Shotcut was only allowing 49.9x. So I exported
                        that version and then put the result back on Shotcut to speed it up 2.3x so it would fit on the 3 minute mark.
                        Here's the video of the process:

                        <b>STRANGER NIGHT | R. J. MAC.</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Hello!
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to make this album cover inspired by the synth horror music from movies from John Carpenter, that was honored in the Netflix series Stranger Things.
                        <br>
                        To keep up with my John Carpenter vibe I used an inspired name from one of my favorite movies The Thing for the artist.
                        <br>
                        I found this picture and really like the neon from the gas station and immediately saw tutorials on how to do my own neon signs on GIMP.
                        <br><br>
                        The album tittle one was the hardest because of all the shadows but I knew I really wanted it to pop, and I think it matches my vision well. The artist’s name, I chose a more muted color since I did not want to make it busy, but I think it still is prominent since it’s right at the top.
                        <br>
                        The back cover was trickier, since it had more text, I had to mute the color to make the text show and try to incorporate the neon signs in the front cover.
                        <br>
                        I used GIMP for this cover and the font I used was Segoe UI.
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/albumCover/Mariana_Brandao/albumcover8.png"><br>
                    <p>
                        Also, just a small message to everyone who sees this 😊
                        <br>
                        I had a really hard time coming up with ideas not only for this project but for the movie poster and logo as well. I might have begun at least 7 movie posters and deleted them all. It’s hard being creative and seeing so many submissions from other people that are really good, and you can’t help comparing your work with them. But for this album cover I decided not to care so much and just try and finish what I started; it might not be perfect but it’s better than to just never doing anything. Good luck!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After deciding to make this design based on the Fjällräven Kånken Bags, mainly on their colorful and customizable
                        aspect, the first step was to choose the images that were going to be used. For that, I used the design studio in the
                        Fjällräven's website to create several bags whose colors, after some possible adjustments, would combine well (shown
                        below): the initial goal was to create a quasi-triadic color scheme.<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/Publicist/LucasPiper/fjällräven_kånken_bags.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Once I had these images, the next step was to create a jigsaw puzzle-like bag that seemed to be "under construction",
                        but also had some color harmony. In order to achieve this, some offset among the bags was added, different parts of each
                        bag were masked in Photoshop and different color balancing filters were applied. The goal was to minimize the
                        inconsistencies in the saturation and the brightness of the colors, given that a hue-wise selection was already made.
                        In the final design, the assembling bag look was also improved with the use of some splatter brushes and the Path Blur
                        filter that allowed to produce the converging colors close to the bag. </p>
                    <img src="resources/publicist/LucasPiper/fjällräven_kånken_bag_mix.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        For the text and background colors, I chose to stick with the brand's white and red identity which not only creates some
                        consistency but also allows for a minimalist design that contrasts with the chaotic nature of the assembling bag, in
                        order to guide the viewer's eye into the main element in the middle.

                        Regarding the text, I used Fjällräven Kånken's font (Arctic Fox) and the Frankfurter font on which Arctic Fox was based.
                        These different font weights and sizes aim to establish some visual hierarchy to emphasize the main selling point here:
                        the idea that this product allows for individuality expression by having a possibly unique set of colors chosen by the
                        client. Finally, the weight on the bottom of the poster was pushed towards the left in order to open up some space for
                        the Fjällräven's logo (shown below) to be in the top right corner and, thus, balancing the final result. </p>

                    <p>Hello, here's my attempt at the publicist skill!
                    
                        <b>Creation Process:</b>
                        
                        At first, I had some difficulty choosing which product to advertise. I'm a vegetarian, but when I have the opportunity,
                        I like to opt for totally vegan products and it's always a pleasant surprise to find out that products that I used to
                        normally consume, without thinking about their composition, are actually completely plant-based. Two examples of this
                        are Oreos and Somersby.
                        
                        Regarding the aesthetics of the ad, one thing I always like is when famous paintings are used to advertise a product. It
                        is as if, for a moment, the subway ad boards became an art gallery. So I decided to go with that.
                        
                        After thinking (quite) a bit about how to advertise one of the products I mentioned using art, I remembered this
                        painting of Adam and Eve, which is all about Somersby - especially since their logo is an apple tree.                   </p><br>
                    <img src="resources/Publicist/FranciscaPaiva/quadro.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        The next step was obvious: replacing the apple in their hands with a Somersby can. I had never used Photoshop before, so
                        this was a first, but with some color, brightness and saturation adjustments, I think it turned out relatively well.
                        
                        I knew the product was too small, considering that it should be the main focus of the poster, but there was no way to
                        make it bigger while keeping the concept of the ad, so I decided to add a glass of Somersby and an apple closer, in the
                        corner of the poster, as the brand itself usually does in advertisements.
                        
                        For the brand name, I decided to put a wooden board hanging, like the ones that exist in orchards, but even after
                        searching a lot, I didn't find one that I liked, so, from a wooden background and the image of some ropes, I built my
                        own board and added the Somersby logo to it.
                        
                        For each element I added, I was careful to adjust the interior and exterior shadows to match the direction in which the
                        sunlight illuminates the elements in the painting.
                        
                        Finally, I added the tagline, which, of course, would have to do with the temptation so associated with the apple that
                        Eve ate, and a banner at the bottom of the poster to add some contrast. So, I came up with my first two prototypes:
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/Publicist/FranciscaPaiva/Somersby_Ad_Poster_1.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <img src="resources/Publicist/FranciscaPaiva/Somersby_Ad_Poster_2.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        However, I was not entirely satisfied.
                        
                        <b>Final Result:</b>
                        
                        Therefore, I decided to replace the banner with a tree branch, to better match the painting and the theme itself. Now, I
                        couldn't put the tagline on top of the branch, as it would have very little contrast. After looking at some ads from the
                        brand for inspiration, I noticed that they often use a hand holding a card with a phrase, so I decided to incorporate
                        that.
                        
                        Here's the final result:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hi everyone, here is my first try at this skill.<br><br>
                        I have been thinking about this skill for some time, wondering what theme I could use or if I wanted true or fake news to be shared. A few days ago, I just came up with something: Some pretty strange news would be for a broadcast company to share that it actually does not have any news to share. A bit of a stretch, but it got me to writing and I ended up pleased with the idea itself.<br><br>
                        After the writing process, it was time to get to the filming phase. As a location, I used my local auditorium where I am used to do act, just because it's big, dark, and has a full photography kit that ended up being very much helpful. Here is a small photo I took of the whole setup:<br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="resources/reporter/Daniel_Goncalves/IMG_20210321_154910-min (1).jpg" style="max-width: 500px;"><br>

                    <p>
                        After almost an hour of pressing record and stop several times, I ended up with something that I thought could work, so I jumped to the editing phase.
                        <br><br>
                        I used After Effects to adjust a graphics pack that I've downloaded, then exported everything and used Premiere to finish up a full comp of the "show”.
                        <br><br>
                        But something "strange" ended up happening: I guess I became a little bit too excited about this skill and, at the end, I had a video with almost 4 minutes and not the 30 seconds that are required. I really didn't want to ignore this long version because I think that it has some good elements, so I am making them available so that you can watch it online if you want.
                        <br><br>
                        I will also give you the link for the small version that I also made available online so that the quality could be a bit better.
                        <br><br>
                        I hope you like it!

                    <p>
                        What if I told you that aliens come from beneath, and not above? 

                        It was with this thought in mind that an idea came to me...

                        The ocean always terrified me, and searching for pictures to use in my work will definitly give me nightmares, but here you can see my attempt at this skill.

                        I found all my pictures on Pinterest, and here are the ones used:<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/AlienInvasions/1.jpeg" style="max-width: 200px;"><br>
                    <img src="resources/AlienInvasions/2.jpg" style="max-width: 200px;"><br>

                    <img src="resources/AlienInvasions/4.jpeg" style="max-width: 200px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        For the editing, I used Gimp. I deleted the background of all the pictures and blended them with the ocean. For the
                        spaceships, I placed an image of the sea above, with little opacity, to blend them well with the ocean. For the aliens,
                        I looked for the most terrifying ones I could find, and also placed some spacecrafts near them, although they should be
                        considered submarines. Not much was changed regarding the lighting, but I had to make all the images more transparent in
                        order to blend them with the ocean. And also to give the illusion of being under water.
                        
                        Here you can see the final result:

                    <p> 
                        
                        Hello, here's my attempt at the pixel art skill!<br>

                        <b>Creation Process:</b><br>
                        When I told my boyfriend that one of the tasks I could do for this course was a pixel art animation, he insisted that I
                        create an animation about the main character of an anime he is a big fan of - Monkey. D. Luffy from One Piece. Even
                        though I have never watched this anime, I decided to give it a go. Thus, I asked him how Luffy was like and he showed me
                        some videos from where I could get some inspiration. Here's one of the videos that he showed me:

                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOdyCmvQmEE

                        It portrays one of Luffy's most distinctive characteristics, which is that he is a rubber-man, so he can stretch his
                        body parts. He also told me that his iconic strawhat was his most important treasure and that was when I came up with
                        the idea of somehow creating an animation with Luffy catching his hat by stretching his arm.

                        First, I needed to create my main character. I really liked this pixel art I found on the internet, so I decided to use
                        it as a base for my Luffy, which I designed using <b>Aseprite</b>:
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/luffy.jpg" style="width: 200px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        After some adjustments in the shading, his feet and specially his face, his size in the default position ended up being <b>26x37px</b>.

                        I then proceded to create the background. I didn't really know from the start what colors I wanted to use, so it was
                        basically a process of trial and error until I was satisfied with the result. I also incorporated a windmill, since
                        there's one in Luffy's native town. For the sky, I applied some dithering in order to make a smooth transition between
                        the shades.

                        In the end, the palette I used had a total of <b>32 colors</b>:<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/palette.png" style="width: 384px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Some of them look very similar because they were used to create shadings in the various elements. I also tried to reuse
                        some colors between different elements - for example, the windmill colors are also present on the ground and on Luffy's
                        skin, shoes and pants.
                        
                        Final Result:<br>
                        After creating the background, I still needed something to make the strawhat leave its owner, so I thought that it would
                        be a nice idea if suddenly a gust of wind came by and the hat flew away. Then, Luffy would strech his arm to get it
                        back, whith the added detail of when the arm unstretches it doesn't move in a straight line.
                        
                        The final animation ended up having a size of <b>135x100px</b>and a total of <b>44 frames</b>.
                        
                        Here's the result:<br>

                    <p> Creation Process:<br>
                    
                    After selecting the Aseprite software for the development of this pixel art animation, the first challenge was to choose
                    a scene that not only led up to some potentially appealing renderings but also allowed for the implementation of Ollie
                    Johnston e Frank Thomas' Twelve Basic Principles of Animation. For that, I decided to animate an astronaut moving in
                    space.
                    
                    Secondly, I chose to use ENDESGA's EDG32 palette that was already available in Aseprite (shown below), given that it
                    allowed for the complementary color scheme that I was aiming for and simultaneously had a range of values for each hue
                    that made possible some differentiation between the character, the foreground and the background. Nevertheless, I only
                    ended up using <b>19 colors</b> from these 32.<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/11.png" style="max-width: 200px;">
                    <p>
                        Regarding the character's animation, I began by rendering the full character to have a sense of its main parts in order
                        to later separate and animate them individually. As shown below, the character was drawn with a <b>21px height</b>, having into
                        consideration an upper right light source and exaggerating the head proportions. Note also that, despite already
                        planning ahead a left-to-right movement, the character was not drawn in profile, since it would detriment its appeal and
                        contradict the Staging principle.<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/22.png" style="max-width: 200px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        As displayed, the following step was to start by animating the character's bounding box to have a sense of its varying
                        width and height, while applying the Squash and Stretch principle. Next, I animated the astronaut's 3 main parts (the
                        head, the body and the jetpack), adjusting some frames relative to the box animation to preserve the character's area
                        when needed. Once that was done, it was only a matter of rendering the character in each frame, adding some particles
                        and the blinking lights in the bodysuit (as shown in the first and second still frames below).
                        
                        There were also some details that were taken into consideration:
                        
                        1.The motion of the astronaut, while flying was described following a sinusoidal curve, respecting the Arcs principle;<br>
                        2.To create the illusion of the jetpack's weight and to add some Follow Through and Overlapping Action, the jetpack ends
                        up describing an overshooting motion in the top point of the jump, as seen in the third frame below;<br>
                        3.The jump begins with no ease-in but ends with an ease-out motion to create the idea of gravity on the moon and
                        exaggerate the power of the jump. However, the falling motion is almost linear, conveying the notion of low gravity;<br>
                        4.Both ease-in and ease-out were applied to the horizontal motion.<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/austronaut.gif" style="max-width: 250px;"><br>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/astrofat.png" style="width: 250px;"><br>
                    <img src="resources/PixelArt/astro thin.png" style="width: 250px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Regarding the foreground, the lines were drawn using Aseprite's pixel-perfect option to avoid doubles (the same option
                        was used for the outline of the character); jaggies were also avoided. As for the astronaut's shade and the shading in
                        the dunes and the craters, everything was done manually with no dithering tool. In the background, however, the
                        dithering tool was used with the <b>Bayer Matrix 8x8</b> setting in the sky and <b>Bayer Matrix 4x4</b> setting in the planet. Besides
                        the planet and the shining stars, a shooting star describing an arc was also included.
                        
                        The final result is <b>120x120 px</b>.

                    <p>
                        My submission was inspired by this week's lab, and before I talk about the process I wanna show the GIF to avoid spoilers:<br>
                        <img src="resources/pixelArt/Andre_Araujo/Pixel-Art.gif" style="max-width: 300px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        You've been Rick Rolled!
                        <br><br>
                        After the lab I had Never Gonna Give You Up stuck in my head so I decided to Rick Roll the entire course. To be a surprise he had to be hidden in the beginning of the GIF and I was torn between a waterfall reveal or a curtain reveal, I chose the waterfall because it would be more unexpected and it would be a nice challenge.
                        <br><br>
                        I was originally going to make the waterfall split but that would have been more difficult and the opacity change is also a nice effect that looks like you're going through the water.
                        <br><br>
                        To make this Pixel Art I used Adobe Photoshop. I know it wasn't recommended, and I understood why later, some features like pixel-perfect lines were missing, but I know Photoshop's layout and features well so I chose to use it anyway after watching a tutorial on how to set it up for pixel art.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose a canvas of 100x100, this size fits well with my ~32x32 character and left room to detail the background. I experimented with a 50x50 canvas but found it to restrictive for some of my more complex ideas.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall I chose to use Shading instead of Dithering, mostly because I'm not a big fan of how dithering looks.
                        <br><br>
                        I used about 3 colors for each object, some more for the rocks and water since they intersected and I needed the gradients between them. Practically I used 32 colors but since I merged some layers with different opacities the end result has some more colors. Here's the palette I used:<br>

                    <p>
                        Then I detailed the skeletons and separated the different body parts to be able to combine them in different positions to make Rick dance, here's Rick's decapitated head:<br>

                    <p> I followed some tutorials to make the waterfall and the rocks, the most relevant innovations being, using the tweens feature in Photoshop to add the frames of the falling waterfall foam and using a noise filter to add sparks to the foam in the waterfall so I didn't have to do it manually for every frame:<br></p>
                    <img src="resources/pixelArt/Andre_Araujo/waterfall.gif" style="max-width: 300px;"><br>
                    <p> 
                        For the waterfall zoom, I saved 12 frames and enlarged the images using the Nearest Neighbor method to avoid adding transparent pixels. This was a terrible decision because it distorted the image and I had to go frame by frame fixing jaggies and weird proportions.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally I added a microphone as my object and stopped because I was always coming up with new ideas and could have easily done this for one more week.
                        <br><br>
                        I also did a version that reversed the animation at the end of the GIF because the cut felt a bit rough but I wasn't sure which version I preferred:<br>

                    <p>
                        Hey everyone,<br>

                        So, my goal was to capture the essence that was usually present in animated series from the 90's such as Berserk or Cowboy Beepbop etc.. in pixel art. In this shows most of the frames were handpainted and that gave them a unique look that is harder to find nowadays. They can also be identified by their more saturated colors as seen in the following images:<br>
                        <img src="resources/pixelArt/Joao_Silva/cowboybeebop.jpeg" style="max-width: 300px;">
                        <img src="resources/pixelArt/Joao_Silva/guts.png" style="max-width: 230px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        I found the scene from Berserk, in the right, where guts is training by swinging his enormous sword. I essentially replicated this scene but from a different angle and added new details. To achieve my desired result I had to tackle different challenges, shadows, gradients, metal and a relatively complex animation.  I started by quickly drawing a barebones version of the animation using only black pixels. <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/pixelArt/Joao_Silva/pixil-gif-drawing (7).gif" style="max-width: 200px;">
                    <img src="resources/pixelArt/Joao_Silva/pixil-gif-drawing (8).gif" style="max-width: 200px;"><br><br>
                    <p>
                        Once I was happy with the motion I added details and improved the animation even further. I also increased the sword size simply because it looked cooler :)
                        <br><br>
                        I then decided to improve the look of the sword by giving it a more metallic look. I used the same principles that can be used to paint metallic swords in miniatures from warhammer.
                        <br><br>
                        I left the character outlined in black because I wanted it to have the most emphasis in the pixel art. Like in the right imagem I wanted the background to be more like a painting, so I did not outline anything. I also added some dithering to have a more gradient-like look. <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/pixelArt/Joao_Silva/pixil-frame-0 (17).png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><br>
                    <p>
                        Because of the size of the sword I figured that some of the dust from the floor would go up as he stopped it, this effect is seen in many animes. Finally, I improved the shading and added a falling leaf which would be cut by the huge sword. I hope you enjoy the final result as much as I enjoyed creating it :D I used https://www.pixilart.com/ to create this pixel art.<br>

                    <p>
                        This took me way too long, but I'm pretty happy with the result! This was my first time both doing pixel art and animating so I had to rely heavily on taking inspiration from different places and adapting them to my own style, which turned out to be a painstakingly long process!
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to make an animation that could be used in a game and was inspired by some futuristic gun designs like these. I instantly thought of animating some kind of plasma weapon with lights indicating when it would shoot. It's a nice touch overall and being a game designer myself it's a great way to indicate an enemy is about to attack. For the plasma beam itself I looked at a few animations of lightning strikes, tried to replicate the lightning effect and added some weight to it (in green) to make it feel more palpable!<br>

                    <p>For the design of the character and scene I was heavily inspired by 2d side-scroller games, mostly by Lost Fortress, which has a really strong art direction and beautiful animations. I learned a lot about the weight of each motion by studying their animation process.<br></p>

                    <p>
                        Hello, here's my attempt at the Stop Motion skill!<br>

                        Creation process: 
                        At first, I was trying to come up with an idea for a stop motion without thinking if I had the materials needed to
                        actually do it. I rapidly realized that I needed to think the other way around and, from the things I had at home, try
                        to conceive an idea. After some thought, I decided to use fruits and vegetables as my characters.
                        
                        I watched some videos on YouTube for inspiration and this one in particular caught my attention:
                        
                        https://youtu.be/3DFzjP6PbnU
                        
                        Inspired by this video, I came up with the story "The Life of Tommy, the Tomato". To create the characters faces, I used
                        plasticine:<br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="resources/StopMotion/1.jpg" style="max-width: 600px;"><br>
                    <p> The shooting scenario was my kitchen, as it was the most adequate place for a story involving food. Of course, I had to choose the only room in the house without blinds... So, in order to get constant lighting during the filming process, I covered all the windows with blankets and always had the same lights turned on. Here's a photo of it:<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/StopMotion/2.jpg" style="max-width: 600px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Most scenes took place in the best illuminated place in the kitchen, but I made changes to the background objects to
                        create different scenarios. I also used different camera angles in most stages of the story.
                        
                        To record and edit the video, I used my smartphone with the app Stop Motion Studio, since it allowed me to overlap the
                        previous photo with the current one, which came in really handy. The frame rate was 10 fps and the final result ended up
                        being composed by 1210 frames.
                        
                        Since I don't have a tripod for my smartphone, I used my camera tripod and, as the good engineer that I am, I fixed the
                        smartphone with tape and a clothespin:
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/StopMotion/3.jpg" style="max-width: 600px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to record some more complex scenes, like the tomato jumping, or going down/up the countertop, but I wasn't able
                        to record them myself, so my boyfriend helped me with those parts. Those scenes also required additional materials, such
                        as plasticine to help the characters maintain their positions and a thin nylon thread to hang them when needed.
                        
                        This was not an easy task at all and it took me two days just to record the video. A few incidents occurred during the
                        process, namely, some of the actors got injured (or eaten by my mom), but the show had to go on, even with some
                        improvisations:
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/StopMotion/4.jpg" style="max-width: 600px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        Editing:<br>

                        For the editing, I used Shotcut. In order to allow a complete immersion in my story, I applied some sound effects, such as water moving and knife cuts. For the voices, I used a video of cartoon chipmunks talking. As they were talking much faster than what I wanted to, I used Audacity to slow down the audio. I added the Fade In and Fade Out effects in some of them so the transitions don't sound too harsh. For the background music, I used some happy songs from the following video:

                        https://youtu.be/1W9YCSLKf-0

                        as well as the song in the first video.

                        I then added subtitles and the ending credits and, finally, a film filter, to give it more of a movie vibe.

                        Final result: 

                        Even though it's not perfect (especially in the more complex parts), I actually enjoyed the final result!

                        This is my submission for the Kinetic video!
                        <br><br>
                        The song I chose was <b>Levels</b> by <b>Nick Jonas</b>.<br><br>
                        I wanted to start off strong and so I used the After Effects software to compose the entire song.
                        (The rendering took a looong time but I think it was worth it).
                        <br><br>
                        The song has stars off with "levels, levels, levels" so for the porpuse of generating that illusion I created multiple layers throughout the entire song, composed with a three dimensional camera that "moved around" changing its position to display the lyrics.
                        <br><br>
                        You can see here an example of a 3 dimensional camera's views on After Effects:<br>

                        Besides that, I tried matching the lyrics with the song's rythm thus the amount of movement of the video with rotations (in 2D and 3D), change of brightness/contrast/opacity/positions, scales and skews.. etc
                        (I dont think I over did it tho, or at least I hope so).
                        <br><br>
                        For more visual effects, and because as I said, the song has a lot of rythm, I also used a lot of videos  with green screen that I found on YouTube and applied the keying or luma effect.
                        <br><br>
                        Last but not least I sometimes changed the font displayed to match the meaning of the lyrics.<br>
                        Just to give some examples, for the word "supernatural" I used a zombie looking font, and for the word "now" I used a clock looking font.
                        <br><br>
                        And that's it!<br>
                        I spent a lot of time on this so I really hope you like it! ahah :)<br>

                    <p>
                        Hi, this is my contribution for this skill!
                        <br><br>
                        I've been wanting to do this skill for a while, but I knew it would take a lot of work, time and inspiration, so it took a while for me to gain strength and start it.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose the song <b>505</b> by <b>Arctic Monkeys</b>, which I really love, specially because not only this specific music has meaning in its lyrics, as all the other songs from this band.
                        <br><br>
                        I used iMovie to work on this, and since it doesn’t have a lot of effects I also used Keynote which allowed me to work on the text and image animations.  Here is the iMovie interface.<br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/kinetic/Rafaela_Timoteo/interface (1).png" style="max-width: 600px;"><br>
                    <p>
                        I wanted the vibe of the video to be like the one they always give on their video work, so I did my research and started by finding a font that is very similar to one of the ones they use on their band’s name which is called Marola. I also used parts of some videos of them, from different video clips and even concerts, specially on the parts of the song on which there was only instrumental - I had to cut them, work on their speed whatsoever.
                        <br><br><br>
                        There are some clips where I used a chroma key effect to either have some fonts in front of a video or the opposite - where the fonts showed the movement of the video whilst the rest was black around - this fonts would be worked on keynote mostly. I also tried to vary the animations as possible as I could, but I also didn’t want it to get too much of a mixture to the point where it would lose the sense of it. The transitions are mostly done by using blur and fading to black. The videos from the band give a good vintage, rock vibe, and then I complemented the best I could with the text and images, but I can tell you it was no easy work, yet a very pleasing one while working on this skill.
                        <br><br>
                        This truly was a challenge, it’s indeed a very hard skill and it takes a lot of time and effort to create something to be really proud of. I like what I did, and I hope you do too.<br>

                        For this skill I decided to talk about a topic that is very close to us: "How to survive to IST".

                        For the script I started by explaining what the podcast is about and introducing myself, moving on to tips or my own
                        experience on how to see IST with other eyes and get the best out of it! I decided to end up by launching the theme of
                        the next fictional episode and by saying to stay tuned.

                        As for the editing, I did everything in Audacity and resorted to changes in amplifications, noise removal, fade-in and
                        fade-outs, ...

                        I also chose to use a background music to give some atmosphere.

                        I hope you like the final result.

                        <b>Process:</b>
                        
                        My first idea for this podcast was to talk about great movies and why they are considered classics among many. Seeing
                        how I understood these topics better than most things I decided to try it out. I wanted to compare good movies to ok
                        ones so as to see what failed in ones that others excelled at, but after thinking about it a bit, it would probably be a
                        very long and very subjective discussion so I tried to think about something more generic and that would be a more
                        interesting topic. That's why I decided to talk about Spielberg, since he is regarded by many experts as a master at
                        filmmaking. I also researched a bit about him and his movies despite knowing his work, just to make sure I had enough
                        information to go on.
                        
                        To start the episode I wanted a catchy jazz tune that I could do my intro lines over and it came out well.
                        
                        As for background music I also wanted something jazzy with a classy vibe so I searched for non-copyright music of that
                        genre and found some interesting tunes. To avoid making it monotonous I choose clips from a few songs just to mix it up
                        a little and to keep the listener more captivated.
                        
                        Because this is an audio skill and because I was talking about movies I decided to add in some very tiny audio clips of
                        the soundtracks when I mentioned them, to help make my point across.
                        
                        For editing the audio I used Audacity and had voice and music in different tracks, so changing properties or adding
                        effects was pretty simple. I made sure to silence the breaths I took or any other annoying sound to avoid disturbing the
                        listener, I also used a bit of compression to correct some of the spikes and also to make it sound smoother. Added fade
                        ins and fade outs to the music clips to improve the transitions and also adjusted the volume to not overshadow my voice.
                        
                        The voice recording quality came out pretty good because recently I bought a professional microphone for exactly these
                        situations so there wasn't much need to correct it or improve it.
                        
                        In the end I think the result was pretty good for my first podcast, I do want to add that I talk somewhat fast in the
                        recording but that's mainly because I didn't want to seem like I was reading an essay and also because that's just how I
                        speak sometimes.

                        <p>
                            Hello,<br>
                            this is my submission for the course image skill:<br>
                        </p>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/MyCourseImage2.jpg"style="width: 600px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            Process:
                            <br><br>
                            I used a mockup I found online and work the entire process throughout Photoshop and Illustrator.
                            <br><br>
                            I wanted to do something original, so I ended up changing the mockup itself to fit in with my expectations.
                            The original mockup had the "traditional" business card: 8.9 x 5.1 cm
                            I ended up cropping the shape of it in order to have the same shape as the logo I created for the course.
                            First I changed the card's white base:
                        </p>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/base1.jpg" style="width: 400px;"><br>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/base2.jpg" style="width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>Then I changed the shadows too:</p>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/shadow1.jpg" style="width: 400px;"><br>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/shadow2.jpg" style="width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>So the final result would look like this:</p>
                        <img alt="" src="resources/courseImage/Monica_Alves/final (1).jpg" style="width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            I also added separately some elements from the logo: The camera lens can be seen in the final result as a type of watermark on the envelopes, the front of the business card and the stationary page. I also added the eye's line on the small envelope's front.
                            <br><br>
                            The original logo had exclusively an intense blue color and so I decided to go for a monochrome schema.
                            <br><br>
                            Lastly, the mockup also had this big envelope so I added it as an attachment.
                            <br><br>
                            Hope you like it!

                            <br><br>
                            I was quite happy with my logo from the Course Logo skill, so I decided to keep it. I also kept the font I used in that skill. Since the idea for the logo was that it could work or by being placed on a white background, or a white version being placed on a gradient background, but didn't want to simply place a logo and call it, I varied it a bit.
                            <br><br>
                            Here are the mockup templates I used: <br>

                            For the paper based elements, I decided to offset and rotate the logo and have it fade into the background so that there isn't much more going on in the background. I added a "Peergrading Training" Notebook, and added an indented logo, to add some depth and variety. For the app I thought it would be fun to create a mockup interface to serve the MCP app. There is also a cd sleeve for a "Hall of Fame" collection, that I imagined could be distributed as a "sample" of sorts for the course.

                        <p>
                            Description:<br>
                            The trailer that I decided to recreate was the one from Midsommar (2019): a thriller/folk horror movie that, despite
                            achieving the terrifying mood it's aiming for, does it with almost incoherent visuals (during the day, very bright
                            scenes, colourful photography and so on). Thus, my idea was to create a trailer that aligned the visuals with the plot –
                            transforming the movie from a thriller to a lighthearted adventure movie.

                            Other than the final lettering announcing the title and the release date, all other scenes were extracted from the
                            original movie. The lettering was obtained from the original trailer. All editing was then done in Shotcut.

                            As for the music, I chose the upbeat music Daylight by Matt & Kim. However, given that the lyrics from the song could
                            interfere with the set of dialogues that I wanted to include in the trailer, I ended up using this instrumental from the
                            same song. Since the music has a repetitive nature, it was not too hard to cut it from almost three minutes to roughly
                            one in a seamless manner (for a more compact trailer).

                            The main idea for the trailer was to show the protagonists travelling in the beginning, being introduced to the festival
                            (where the bulk of the movie takes place), followed by several moments that happened there always in a cheerful way. In
                            the end, I chose to reduce the time each scene was displayed while the music becomes gradually louder allowing for the
                            climax to coincide with the moment the movie title is finally revealed. In spite of this narrative, before the studio
                            and main producer were presented, I decided to show a snippet of the movie as a lead-in.

                            The scenes used in the trailer were obtained to convey the narrative discussed above. However, by the end of the
                            trailer, I also considered intriguing scenes (to encourage curiosity), scenes that contained the main characters (to
                            introduce them) and scenes that were just overall appealing.

                            Finally, part of the task of changing a trailer’s mood is to choose what to show and what to omit. As such, I decided to
                            not represent the part where the characters that were invited to the festival are freaking out and want to leave. I
                            chose the dialogues to only convey the following key ideas: the characters are travelling to a special festival that
                            seldom takes place, by invitation of a friend in hopes of having fun.

                        </video><br>
                        <p> After receiving feedback i decided to improve it.<br>
                            the following changes were made:<br>

                            The difference in volume between the dialogues and the background music was increased slightly, namely in the last dialogue, in order to improve clarity;
                            The music was increased during the studio and main producer presentation and in the final crescendo to make the trailer more "catchy";
                            The chosen scenes, in the end, were selected to restate the lighthearted adventure theme of the trailer, using the same colours as the remaining trailer, with no use of nudity and showcasing more ceremonies from the festival the characters are in. One of the new scenes also allowed to introduce one more important character that wasn't introduced through an isolating shot.

                            Final Result:

                        <p>
                            Hey!
                            <br><br>
                            As soon as I decided to do this skill I knew that I wanted to go with a film that I'd recently seen, so that I remembered it well. I first thought of various films I recently enjoyed... but then decided on "I Care a Lot". This is a hyped commercial film, that falls under the genres of Comedy, Crime, Thriller. These are genres that I don't really gravitate towards and this film was no different in that it really wasn't much to my taste; yet I was intrigued by their usage of the criticism of capitalism as.. a commercial plot device. 
                            <br><br>
                            So, I thought I could make the retrailer of "I Care a Lot" but sticking to the narrative around capitalism, trashing everything else, the action and the plot altogether. I imagined it would fall under the categories of arthouse, drama, experimental,, very still and contemplative. 
                            <br><br>
                            These genres are quite difficult to mimic as there aren't many fixed rules, usually there is some oddity to them and a lot of experimentation can be seen, in editing and directing, which usually shows in the trailer. I got inspired by Rosefeldt's Manifesto with the idea of a film that is well... a manifesto. I also altered the aspect ratio, following Dolan's Mommy, or even Lowery's A Ghost Story, going for a more claustrophobic feel. I then played around with effects and transitions until I got something that conceptually made sense to me,, the magnifying glass, the circles... the words are taken out of Adrienne Rich's comments on capitalism. The music is Piano Concerto No. 2 III. Uccelli sulle passioni.
                            <br><br>
                            It was actually quite a challenging skill, definitely took longer than I expected to come up with the various ideas and it was also particularly Fun! to remove all the music from behind the dialog of the original film.
                            <br><br>
                            I'm sorry for the dragged out description but I realise it is quite a weird trailer and just wanted to explain my point of view a little better :) hope you like it

                            Since I often use Spongebob GIFs in my spare time, I decided to create my own. However, the GIFs that are made available
                            on mobile phones are usually not looping GIFs, so I had to start looking for a suitable scene. I focused on the songs of
                            the series and tried to find a suitable clip that did not have a static background, as this was often criticized here.
                            I finally decided on a scene from the song "Goofy Goober", in which Plankton flies through the Krusty Krab. </p>

                            So for this project I decided to use a scene from the Gorillaz music video for their 2018 song Tranz. It was actually
                            quite hard to find a good scene that was easy to loop and that had a dynamic background, eventually I settled on this
                            since the fast change of colours made for really interesting visuals.
                            
                            <b>Process:</b>
                            
                            My first action was to screen record the music video. After that I simply edited the video on Shotcut, I tried to cut it
                            on the places where the transition between background colours would be smoother, and then exported it in gif format.
                            
                            I hope you enjoy my work.

                            In order to find a good movie shot that was simultaneously challenging and had some kind of repeating movements, I
                            searched through the work of directors that usually use this kind of scene, mainly Wes Anderson.

                            The scene was extracted from the original film in VEGAS Pro and some of the frames close to the transition were also
                            edited in Photoshop in order to minimize the discontinuities (masking some parts of the faces, fixing the sledge
                            orientation and filling the remaining area with Content-Aware Fill). Once I had the video, I croped,
                            resized and compressed the gif file.<br>

                            For this skill I got my favorite scene from the cult classic "The Shinning" starring Jack Nicholson. The hardest part of
                            this gif was the fact that Jack doesn't strike the door in the same spot every time, so I had to make the cut during the
                            motion. Here's Johnny!!<br>

                        I saw a scene were he was reading a book and I thought it was my shot.

                            Description:

                            For this audiobook, I decided to read the last set of paragraphs from William Golding's <b>The Lord of the Flies (1954)</b>,
                            introducing the action in media res and coinciding the end with the end of the book.

                            I chose this excerpt because it has many descriptions that can be conveyed in audio format, actions that justify playing
                            with the left/right channels, dialogues between the children and a middle-aged man (different voice pitches), a heavy
                            emotional weight in the story that worked well with a soundtrack and more.

                            I began by recording the narrator's part and each characters' voice separately. Then, in <b>Audacity</b>, I removed the
                            background noise and <b>adjusted the pitch</b> to better convey the idea that the officer is a man as opposed to Ralph that
                            still is a child. Secondly, I adjusted the silences and made sure that the loudness of the audio files was uniform by
                            <b>amplifying</b> the audio when required. After that, I imported the sound effects and made the following changes:

                            -One of the fire effects had its speed changed in order to make the sound deeper and longer;
                            -One of the fire effects was played 90% in the right channel as opposed to 10% in the left one, during the description
                            "the fire flapped at his right shoulder";
                            -Echo was applied to the crying sounds to emphasize the loneliness that the characters felt all throughout the story;
                            -The whistle sound is original and had its pitch changed as well;
                            -All effects had some fade in and/or fade out.

                            Finally, after the main audio and the relevant special effects were finished, I added as soundtrack the instrumental of
                            the music Sumer 78 by Yann Tiersen. For the music, I focused on the nostalgic/sorrowful aspect of this excerpt that
                            begins when the dialogues take place and the children have to face up to everything that has happened on the island. For
                            this same reason, I chose to start the soundtrack only after Ralphs reaches the beach where the children meet the
                            officer.

                        <p>
                            Hello!
                            For the audiobook skill, I chose a short tale that a character narrates in the novel From The New World by Yusuke Kishi.
                            The character in the tale is a young boy who is gathering herbs and encounters something dangerous... a fiend!

                            First, I recorded all the voices needed with my phone. After that, I imported all of it to Audacity and eliminated
                            background noise, tongue clicks, and the like, using the effect Noise Gate. I also used Amplify when needed. For the
                            boy's crying and inner voice, I slightly raised the pitch and in the latter used Reverb too.

                            Then, I searched for sound effects on Youtube and imported them too. The Audacity effects used to edit those, in
                            general, were Change Speed, Change Pitch, Amplify, Fade In, Fade Out, and Adjustable Fade.

                            Finally, I selected a suitable soundtrack. I used 3 tracks from the Made in Abyss anime OST, Roar of the Abyss,
                            Treehouse, and Air. I decided on these because they gave an eerie/suspenseful atmosphere to the story and accentuated
                            the fear of the boy.

                    <p>
                        Hello!<br><br>
                        When I first saw this skill on the skill tree I immediately planned my path to try this one out!

                        However, this was way harder than I thought, having to use processing and finding documentation of the Minim and FFT
                        library and/or examples was a challenge. Eventually, I found a GitHub repo with an example of how to analyze the track
                        using processing!

                        Now onto the idea, I initially wanted to reproduce an effect similar to when we put a liquid over a speaker, so I drew
                        some cubes evenly distributed in a circle like shape with a sphere in the middle which I quite liked because it was also
                        similar to having a sun effect spreading through the cubes to the edges, so I decided to go with that.

                        So all was left was the hardest part, combining the shape with the actual track analysis. To do so, I divided the whole
                        shape into rows. The rows closest to the center react more to low frequencies and the further we go the higher the
                        frequencies the cubes react. The reaction of a cube to a specific band is determined by the intensity of that band in
                        the current moment, for example, if a song has more low frequencies the closest rows to the center will have their
                        colors significantly more intense than the cubes in the outer rows. The circle in the center represents the lowest of
                        the lowest so it reacts to the "kicks" in the songs. To make this effect more dynamic the stroke and colors of a cube
                        are directly connected to the intensity so If a band has no intensity at all the cubes are "hidden".

                        The cubes also have a rotation that is faster if the music speeds up, the colors vary throughout the music depending on
                        the low, mid, and high levels of the track. Finally, I added a little "pulse" when certain bands are hit distinguishing
                        the cubes that react to them from the rest!

                        The background also has a slight reaction to the current song level.

                        I've tried the visualizer with some different songs but most of them couldn't hit those higher bands and the change of
                        colors can be a bit abrupt sometimes or too bright, however, I feel that I achieved an effect that I enjoy and have
                        multiple interactions with a song, so here you go!

                        (To play any song you like put it in the same folder as the pde file and change the name to "song" or change the
                        "audioFileName" string at the top of the code to the name of the audio file you want to play!)

                        <p>
                            Hello everyone! Well, I have to admit that this skill is a lot harder than I thought.
                            
                            To begin with I went looking for songs that had similar bpms, notes and styles, as I thought they would be easier to
                            combine. After a lot of searching and trial and error, I decided to use "Hold On" by Chord Overstreet and "Love Story"
                            by Taylor Swift.
                            
                            The first song has key = D and BPM = 120 and the second song has key = D and BPM = 119.
                            
                            I first tried to separate the voices from the instrumental with online applications, but the voices sounded quite
                            robotic. However, I managed to find the acapella version of "Love story" on Youtube, which is what I wanted.
                            
                            The mashup has the instrumental of "Hold On", the vocals of "Love story" and sometimes mixes both.
                            
                            The editing was all done in audacity and includes effects like fade-in and fade-out to make the transitions more subtle,
                            I also modified some amplitudes, and so on.
                            
                            Really hope you like it.<br>

                    <p>
                        Hi! Here is my submission attempt of the radio commercial skill.

                        Process
                        I wanted my product to be used by everyone so to choose it I made a list of things everyone uses. Because the ad would be sounds only, I thought it would be fun to pick something that everyone recognizes with a simple sound - a deodorant.

                        I started writing the script. I needed it to be different from your standard deodorant to captivate the public, so I started writing a bunch of terrible smells that are difficult to wash off. This deodorant can cover it all.

                        So after I wrote the script and reviewed it over and over again I took my microphone and started recording. After a
                        couple recordings when I was happy I edited all in audacity, added sounds to back up my script and an upbeat music on
                        the background.<br>

                        <b>Description:</b>
                        For this radio commercial, I decided to promote the <b>Headapace meditation app</b>, since this allowed me to convey the perks
                        of mindfulness meditation through the following plot with several sound effects which, if well-executed, could lead to a
                        richer final result.
                        
                        I began by recording the Inner Voice, by selecting a possible narrative of someone who has a stressful lifestyle, has
                        many objectives of different natures and, like everyone, isn't immune to insecurity – someone who would benefit from
                        meditation. Then I recorded the Narrator that conveys the idea that the previous "character" is an inner voice and
                        promotes the app, explaining its benefits, and reveals the app's slogan (from the app's site).
                        
                        Regarding the post-processing, all edit was done in<b> Audacity</b>. I began by removing the breaths, adjusting the silences
                        and <b>making the Inner Voice progressively faster</b>. Note also that the <b>inner voice jumps from both channels</b> to the left or
                        the right one to convey the idea that the thoughts are "all over the place" (unable to focus on the present). Then, in
                        order to have both the inner voice and the narrator speaking, I added a <b>low-pass filter</b> to the Inner Voice audio and
                        lowered its loudness.
                        
                        To complement the commercial, I also included some city noises, an energetic percussion sound (to transmit the high-pace
                        lifestyle), a breath sound, a slow-motion one and, finally, uplifting music from Bensound by the end, during the app
                        presentation.

                        <p>
                            Hi there,
                            here is my take on the Negative Space skill.
                            
                            I started brainstorming and first I thought about things I liked like books and like stars and rocket ships but I wasn't
                            really satisfied with this idea since they didn't have a clear or meaningful message. So I thought about making an
                            advertisement, hence the ear drawing, it could be an ad for hearing aids or so, but it was too simple. Then I thought
                            about some causes and impactful things on the environment, and I came up with the idea of raising awareness for habitat
                            destruction, which often occurs to build cities and roads, and that is how I came up with the idea of the road with the
                            animals' outlines, because the construction of this roads kills the animals.
                            
                            Here are the brainstorming drawings:
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/image.png" style="max-width: 500px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            Then I started designing the idea on Inkscape, I used a free road Icon and then searched for foxes, deers and crows
                            icons to cut the outline and then I had the idea of making the strokes look like buildings since it fits the habitat
                            destruction theme, and that is how I came up with the final result:
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/2.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            After taking feedback into consideration, I started thinking about some new ideas and I decided to change the theme so I
                            could use better the negative space of my image, I then had an idea to make it about forest fires but still focused on
                            the animals life. So I decided to use the negative space of a flame (the inner part of the flame):<br>
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/flame.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            And I tried to find an animal that would be similar to represent that inner part and at the same time that animals'
                            lives are at risk when there are forest fires, so I found a squirrel icon that fit, and the flame also kind of looks
                            like the squirrel tail:<br>
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/squirel2.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            When I started looking at the squirrel I was wondering if I could fit other animals in the composition, so I used the
                            curve of the squirrel's "leg" to fit a snail. I also added some birds at the top to represent the "sparks" of the flame.
                            And here is the final result:<br>
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/squirel.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>

                            Hello, here is my attempt for the negative space challenge!<br>
                            <br> 
                            I tried to think of new ways to integrate one of the elements I had mentioned in the free spaces between and around one
                            of the others. It was really hard to come up with a satisfactory idea, but after a lot of thinking, I identified some
                            similarities between the Little Prince's hair and the fox's fur, so I decided to use that to create a new design.<br>
                        </p>
                        <img src="resources/NegativeSpace/Little Prince sketch.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;"><br>
                        <p>
                            Again, I vectorized it using Illustrator and painted it orange, the color of the fox.

                            This is the final result:                        </p>

                        <p>For this skill I had the idea of me nr 1 asking me nr 2 to solve a rubik's cube and then me nr 2 giving it back to me nr
                        1 for inspection. For this I had to film three consecutive scenes: one of me on the couch scrambling the cube, one of me
                        solving it in the chair and one of me inspecting it on the couch afterwards. I pretended to go to the toilet on the
                        first one so that I could come back in the third one.
                        
                        What I had to do was a mask on the second video that would shift to the left or to the right of the table the cube was
                        standing on. To try to make the transition more seamless I tried to adjust the white balance a bit to make the clips
                        match a bit more. I also did a bit of noise reduction in audacity.<br>

                            Hello everyone!<br>

                            Here is my submission for the Doppelganger skill!

                            Firstly, I chose a story for the video which is a girl that meets a new girl that comes to live in her building and only
                            at the end of the video does she realizes that this new girl looks the same as her.

                            Then I made a little script so that I would know the timings of the lines of the characters in my video.

                            After that, I started recording which was a lot harder than I was expecting. I decided to film only with artificial
                            light, to minimize the changes in lighting, but even that way the two parts of the recording had different lighting, and
                            it was very noticeable because my camera was adjusting the brightness automatically. I was getting really frustrated at
                            this, and then I decided to film in the manual mode, to avoid these brightness changes. I filmed all of the scenes like
                            this, and although not perfect in terms of lighting I was satisfied with the result.

                            I then edited the videos in Adobe Premiere: I applied the masks to create the doppelganger effect, changed masks in the
                            beginning when the characters are eating cookies, increased/decreased the speed of some parts of the video (since I
                            barely do any movement in those parts) to improve the synchronization, applied transitions between scenes and added some
                            background music to make it more interesting.

                            Here is the final result:
                        </p>

                        Hi everyone,<br>
                        For this skill i submit a personal story that happen during a family trip in Brazil. I get reminded about it very often,
                        for reasons you'll understand during the story (sorry no spoilers :) ) and decided it was the best one to submit since
                        it happen on a first person basis, and it is short enough to be useful for the skill submission. I dramatized it a
                        little bit, although everything in the story is factual and actually happened.

                        I chose some background songs, all of them from Pixabay, that would match the events happening in the story. To
                        introduce them and cut them out, I mostly used fade in and out except on one occasion to give emphasis to the suspense
                        in the story. I also tried to match the songs with the cadence of my voice, queuing some beats and moments in them to
                        different moments in the story.

                        For my own voice I began by amplifying it, using noise reduction to clear out the static my microphone creates and to
                        improve it, I followed a small give referred by another student on this thread
                        (https://sonix.ai/articles/how-to-make-voices-sound-better-in-your-audio-for-free).

                        I'm quite happy with the result and I hope all of you like it.

                        Hello! This is my submission to First-Person Narration.<br>

                        I wanted to tell a scary story written by me, as I enjoy reading them on Reddit a lot. So I took inspiration from real-life people (my actual friends) and places, but the story is completely made up.
                        
                        So I started to write the script, which took some time to get right, but once I thought it was good, I started to record it over and over again, to make it sound just like I wanted. 
                        
                        I amplified my voice to the right volume and also applied noise reduction to the audio. The microphone is not perfect but I think it does the job after some tweakings here and there. I also took some time to choose which background music would fit this audio and ended up using two of them, as the story moves along. Finally, applied some sound effects (whispering and screaming) and did some fading in and out on the background music
                        
                        And, this is the Final Result.<br>

                            Hello, here is my Animated Publicist submission
                            <br><br>
                            Like some of my colleagues I started off where I left off with Publicist. I decided to keep it simple as I had done for that submission. For the original image I had underlined smart similarly as the logo to draw attention to both words as I wanted them to have a connection. Here I animated the underline in both the word and the logo to further draw in that comparison.
                            <br><br>
                            I made the box and pills move in but from the inside of the frame as give the impression we are peering into something. Then of course everything fades so that the gif may loop.
                            <br><br>
                            I used premiere and ezgif to make this submission.<br>

                    Hi!

                    Here's my pink flamingo snake on the beach. I used <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> for this skill.

                    I used these two pictures:<br>
                 </p>
                 <img src="resources/Morphing/pic1.PNG" style="max-width: 200px;">
                 <img src="resources/Morphing/pic2.PNG" style="max-width: 230px;"><br>
                 <p>
                    As for my process:

                        1.Cut out the snake carefully using the Magnetic Selection tool and some lasso selection corrections
                        2.Erase the flamingo head using Healing Brush Tool
                        3.Position the snake and adjust perspective and size
                        4.Adjust the color of the snake so it's the same as the pink flamingo
                        5.Add shadows and the bright yellow highlights with a brush. On the head of the snake, I painted the highlights carefully, to preserve the texture of the snake<br>
                 </p>

                    The last days i listened a lot to Drum N Bass, so i wanted to do a Remidi to make a Song of that Genre. <br>
                    Furthermore I am from Germany, so i want to Remidi a German song. One of the most popular Bands from Germany is Rammstein. <br>
                    It was my first time, to create my own music and watched a lot of tutorials. I hope you enjoy :)<br>
